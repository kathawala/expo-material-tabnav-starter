# expo-material-tabnav-starter
Mobile Development Starter Kit with React Native + Expo v39 + React Navigation v5 + React Native Paper + Animated Bottom Tab Bar + Typescript

There's a lot of setup that needs to be done to combine [react-native-paper](https://callstack.github.io/react-native-paper/) and [react-navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/) together, specifically getting the themes to play nicely together.
But I like both libraries, so I've combined them here in an easy to use starter kit.

In addition, there are some cool animated bottom tab bars out there, so I included [react-native-animated-tabbar](https://github.com/gorhom/react-native-animated-tabbar)
in this starter kit.
There are 3 different preset animations to choose from, this starter kit uses the "Flashy" preset

You can also use the [Bubble preset](https://github.com/gorhom/react-native-animated-tabbar/blob/master/docs/bubble-preset.md) or the [Material preset](https://github.com/gorhom/react-native-animated-tabbar/blob/master/docs/material-preset.md) if you prefer.

And like all responsible web/mobile starter kits in this day and age, it comes with Typescript configured out of the box.

Installation instructions / screenshots / etc. coming soon.
